Version Control: Git, GitHub
Git
is the de facto standard for version control of software (and sometimes, data as well). It’s a system that keeps track of changes you make to files and folders. It allows you to revert to a previous state, compare changes, etc. It’s a central tool in any developer’s workflow.
GitHub
is the most popular hosting service for Git repositories. It’s a website that shows your code, allows you to collaborate with others, and provides many useful tools for developers.
