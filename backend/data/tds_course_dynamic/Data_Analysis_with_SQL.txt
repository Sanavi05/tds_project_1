Data Analysis with SQL
Youâ€™ll learn how to perform data analysis using SQL (via Python), covering:
Database Connection
: How to connect to a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy and Pandas.
SQL Queries
: Execute SQL queries directly from a Python environment to retrieve and analyze data.
Counting Rows
: Use SQL to count the number of rows in a table.
User Activity Analysis
: Query and identify top users by post count.
Post Concentration
: Determine if a small percentage of users contribute the majority of posts using SQL aggregation.
Correlation Calculation
: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between user attributes such as age and reputation.
Regression Analysis
: Compute the regression slope to understand the relationship between views and reputation.
Handling Large Data
: Perform calculations on large datasets by fetching aggregated values from the database rather than entire datasets.
Statistical Analysis in SQL
: Use SQL as a tool for statistical analysis, demonstrating its power beyond simple data retrieval.
Leveraging AI
: Use ChatGPT to generate SQL queries and Python code, enhancing productivity and accuracy.
