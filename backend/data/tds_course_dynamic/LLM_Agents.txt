LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act
LLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.
What Makes an Agent?
An LLM agent consists of three core components:
LLM Brain
: Makes decisions about what to do next
Tools
: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)
Memory
: Retains context across multiple steps
Agents operate through a loop:
Observe the environment
Think about what to do
Take action using tools
Observe results
Repeat until task completion
Command-Line Agent Example
We’ve created a minimal command-line agent called
llm-cmd-agent.py
that:
Takes a task description from the command line
Generates code to accomplish the task
Automatically extracts and executes the code
Passes the results back to the LLM
Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails
Here’s how it works:
uv run llm-cmd-agent.py
"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size"
uv run llm-cmd-agent.py
"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML"
Copy to clipboard
Error
Copied
The agent will:
Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes
Execute the script in a subprocess
Capture the output (stdout and stderr)
Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation
Present a final answer to the user
Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow:
Initial prompt to generate a shell script
Code extraction from the LLM response
Code execution in a subprocess
Result interpretation by the LLM
Error handling and retry logic if needed
This demonstrates the core agent loop of:
Planning (generating code)
Execution (running the code)
Reflection (interpreting results)
Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)
Agent Architectures
Different agent architectures exist for different use cases:
ReAct
(Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions
Reflexion
: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning
MRKL
(Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules
Plan-and-Execute
: Creates a plan first, then executes steps
Real-World Applications
LLM agents can be applied to various domains:
Research assistants
that search, summarize, and synthesize information
Coding assistants
that write, debug, and explain code
Data analysis agents
that clean, visualize, and interpret data
Customer service agents
that handle queries and perform actions
Personal assistants
that manage schedules, emails, and tasks
Project Ideas
Here are some practical agent projects you could build:
Study buddy agent
: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts
Job application assistant
: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses
Personal finance agent
: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities
Health and fitness coach
: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation
Course project helper
: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work
Best Practices
Clear instructions
: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations
Effective tool design
: Create tools that are specific and reliable
Robust error handling
: Agents should recover gracefully from failures
Memory management
: Balance context retention with token efficiency
User feedback
: Allow users to correct or guide the agent
Limitations and Challenges
Current LLM agents face several challenges:
Hallucination
: Agents may generate false information or tool calls
Planning limitations
: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities
Tool integration complexity
: Each new tool adds implementation overhead
Context window constraints
: Limited memory for long-running tasks
Security concerns
: Tool access requires careful permission management
