Marimo
is a new take on notebooks that solves some headaches of Jupyter. It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.
Marimoâ€™s cells canâ€™t be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.
It also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive.
