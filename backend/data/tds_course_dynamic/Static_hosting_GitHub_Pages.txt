Static hosting: GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages
is a free hosting service that turns your GitHub repository directly into a static website whenever you push it. This is useful for sharing analysis results, data science portfolios, project documentation, and more.
Common Operations:
# Create a new GitHub repo
mkdir
my-site
cd
my-site
git
init
# Add your static content
echo
"<h1>My Site</h1>"
>
index.html
# Push to GitHub
git
add
.
git
commit
-m
"feat(pages): initial commit"
git
push origin main
# Enable GitHub Pages from the main branch on the repo settings page

Error

Best Practices:
Keep it small
Optimize images
. Prefer SVG over WEBP over 8-bit PNG.
Preload
critical assets like stylesheets
Avoid committing large files like datasets, videos, etc. directly. Explore
Git LFS
instead.

GitHub Desktop
: GUI for Git operations
GitHub CLI
