GitHub Codespaces
is a cloud-hosted development environment built right into GitHub that gets you coding faster with pre-configured containers, adjustable compute power, and seamless integration with workflows like Actions and Copilot.
Why Codespaces helps
Reproducible onboarding
: Say goodbye to “works on my machine” woes—everyone uses the same setup for assignments or demos.
Anywhere access
: Jump back into your project from a laptop, tablet, or phone without having to reinstall anything.
Rapid experimentation & debugging
: Spin up short-lived environments on any branch, commit, or PR to isolate bugs or test features, or keep longer-lived codespaces for big projects.
Quick Setup
From the GitHub UI
Go to your repo and click
Code → Codespaces → New codespace
.
Pick the branch and machine specs (2–32 cores, 8–64 GB RAM), then click
Create codespace
.
In Visual Studio Code
Press
Ctrl+Shift+P
(or
Cmd+Shift+P
on Mac), choose
Codespaces: Create New Codespace
, and follow the prompts.
Via GitHub CLI
gh auth login
gh codespace create
--repo
OWNER/REPO
gh codespace list
# List all codespaces
gh codespace code
# opens in your local VS Code
gh codespace
ssh
# SSH into the codepsace

Features To Explore
Dev Containers
: Set up your environment the same way every time using a
devcontainer.json
or your own Dockerfile.
Introduction to dev containers
Prebuilds
: Build bigger or more complex repos in advance so codespaces start up in a flash.
About prebuilds
Port Forwarding
: Let Codespaces spot and forward the ports your web apps use automatically.
Forward ports in Codespaces
Secrets & Variables
: Keep your environment variables safe in the Codespaces settings for your repo.
Manage Codespaces secrets
Dotfiles Integration
: Bring in your dotfiles repo to customize shell settings, aliases, and tools in every codespace.
Personalizing your codespaces
Machine Types & Cost Control
: Pick from VMs with 2 to 32 cores and track your usage in the billing dashboard.
Managing Codespaces costs
VS Code & CLI Integration
: Flip between browser VS Code and your desktop editor, and script everything with the CLI.
VS Code Remote: Codespaces
GitHub Actions
: Power up prebuilds and your CI/CD right inside codespaces using Actions workflows.
